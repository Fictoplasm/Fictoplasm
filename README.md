@Fictoplasm is the name of my [podcast](http://www.fictoplasm.net) [fictoplasm.net] about fiction and RPGs. As well as that, I write RPGs and other stuff.

The profile on GitHub is a bit of an experiment. All of the projects I have here are intended to be public facing RPGs for community consumption and contribution in a controlled way (and allowing forks, etc.).

Fictoplasm/Fictoplasm is a ✨ special ✨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.
